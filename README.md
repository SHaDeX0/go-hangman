# go-hangman

I'm learning a new programming language called [Go](https://go.dev)  
Re-visiting my 12th standard final project I and my friend made.  
Back then we made it using C++ and with help of our teacher.  
This project brought so many memories back to me.  
  
You have to have Golang installed in your system to build and run this game.  
It's a command line Hangman game.  
In this game, you have to guess a country name that the computer has picked randomly from an array (countries) present inside [Play.go](Play.go)  
You will have 10 lives to guess the country's name.  
Game will be over if you guess the country's name or your lives become 0.  
  
Enjoy!
